To help resolve the indexing issues and improve organic traffic on your website, an experienced SEO specialist would typically conduct an in-depth SEO audit and implement various technical SEO, content optimization, and performance tracking strategies. Below is an outline of the Python code that can assist with some of these SEO tasks like auditing your website, checking indexing issues, analyzing page structure, and improving on-page SEO.

This code focuses on the technical SEO audit aspect, which includes crawling the website, checking for broken links, missing metadata, and other SEO-related issues that could impact search visibility. The content optimization part is more manual but could be supported by tools like natural language processing (NLP) for keyword analysis or readability.
Key SEO Audit Tasks in Python Code

    Crawl the website: Checking the website’s structure and making sure all pages are crawled.
    Check for broken links: Ensuring that there are no dead links or errors preventing indexing.
    Check for missing metadata: Verifying that every page has titles, descriptions, and relevant meta tags.
    Check Robots.txt and Sitemap: Ensure the website's robots.txt and sitemap.xml are set up properly to allow crawlers to index the site.
    Track Analytics and Reports: Pull data from Google Search Console and Google Analytics to check the website's performance.

Code Breakdown:

    Technical SEO Checks:
        Robots.txt: check_robots_txt() checks if the website has a robots.txt file and returns its contents.
        Broken Links: check_broken_links() checks the accessibility of the provided URLs, ensuring they’re not returning errors (404s, etc.).
        Page Crawling: crawl_page() pulls metadata, headings, and other essential SEO elements like title, description, and keywords.
        Internal Linking: check_internal_links() checks the internal links on the page to ensure they’re working properly and not broken.
        Sitemap: check_sitemap() checks if the sitemap is present and accessible.

    Google Search Console Integration:
        Google Search Console API: This part integrates with Google Search Console using a service account. You can fetch search analytics, keyword data, and performance reports.
        Replace path_to_your_service_account_credentials.json with the actual path to your Google API credentials JSON file.

    On-Page Optimization:
        The crawl_page() function analyzes page metadata (title, description, keywords) and headings. This helps you check if the page is properly optimized for SEO.

    SEO Audit:
        The seo_audit() function runs all of the above checks and gives you an overview of the website’s technical SEO health.

Additional Steps for the SEO Specialist:

    Content Optimization:
        Regularly review and edit existing articles, ensuring they meet SEO best practices (keyword usage, headings, and proper content structure).
        Suggest content gaps and new blog topics based on keyword research tools (e.g., SEMrush, Ahrefs, or Google Keyword Planner).

    Indexing Issues:
        Manually investigate non-indexed pages through Google Search Console and ensure there are no crawl errors or issues in the robots.txt that could prevent indexing.

    Analytics and Monitoring:
        Set up ongoing monitoring using tools like Google Analytics and Google Search Console to track performance, uncover issues, and provide actionable insights.

    Continuous Optimization:
        Regularly monitor rankings and site performance, adjusting strategies to ensure continuous organic growth.
